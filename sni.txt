# This file contains a list of SNIs that are expected to be whitelisted
# by the censorship blocker and which are to be probed when connecting
# to sites that are blocked, e.g.:
#
# ./sniprobe www.bbc.co.uk 443 sni.txt
#
# webserver on www.bbc.co.uk on their side will miss the
# wrong SNI and return their default X509 certificate and connection
# can continue
#
# If you see Failure messages with 'dial tcp ... i/o timeout' messages the port
# is completely blocked. If you see 'connection refused', this port is either
# closed or blocked. If you see TLS or X509 errors, this SNI is blocked for
# this node:port. If you see Success message, it is open and the https connection
# works.
